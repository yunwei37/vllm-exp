# A Systematic Classification Framework for LLM Serving System Issues

This directory contains the comprehensive classification framework for understanding bugs and performance issues in Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems, based on empirical analysis of production systems.

## Contents

- `classification_framework.md` - Main classification framework document
- `empirical_findings.md` - Detailed empirical findings from the analysis
- `metrics_and_measurements.md` - Proposed metrics for systematic evaluation
- `case_studies.md` - Specific examples illustrating each classification category

## Purpose

This framework is designed to provide a scientific foundation for:
1. Understanding the nature of issues in production LLM serving systems
2. Categorizing problems systematically for better triage and resolution
3. Identifying patterns and trends in system failures
4. Informing future system design decisions

## Target Audience

- Systems researchers working on LLM serving infrastructure
- Engineers building and maintaining LLM serving systems
- Academic researchers studying distributed systems and ML systems
