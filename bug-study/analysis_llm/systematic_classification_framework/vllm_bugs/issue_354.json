    "title": "Loading Models that require execution of third party code (trust_remote_code=True)",
    "body": "I am trying to load MPT using the AsyncLLMEngine:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nengine_args = AsyncEngineArgs(\"mosaicml/mpt-7b-chat\", engine_use_ray=True)\r\nengine = AsyncLLMEngine.from_engine_args(engine_args)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am getting this error:\r\n`ValueError: Loading mosaicml/mpt-7b-chat-local requires you to execute the configuration file in that repo on your local machine. Make sure you have read the code there to avoid malicious use, then set the option `trust_remote_code=True` to remove this error.`\r\n\r\nIs there any workaround for this or could it be possible to add the option to trust remote code to EngineArgs?",
